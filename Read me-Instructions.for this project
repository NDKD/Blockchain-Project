Instructions to run this Blockchain project

open a new gitbash
change the directory to geth-alltools-windows-amd64-1.9.7-a718daa6



From "Geth" Folder # create your first node and copy the key.
Code:
./geth account new --datadir node1

# Create a second node.
./geth account new --datadir node2


# Create a genesis block using puppeth.exe

# Please specify a network name to administer -- network name = vijaysatishnet


# Select   option 2 to use`Clique (Proof of Authority)` consensus algorithm

# Specify your chain or network id -- chain id = 1207

 Paste both account addresses from the first step one at a time into the list of accounts to seal.

    * Paste them again in the list of accounts to pre-fund. There are no block rewards in PoA, so you'll need to pre-fund.

    * Continue with the default option for the prompt that asks, Should the precompile-addresses (0x1 .. 0xff) be pre-funded with 1 wei?

    * Complete the rest of the prompts, and when you are back at the main menu, choose the "Manage existing genesis" option.

    * Export genesis configurations. This will fail to create two of the files, but you only need `networkname.json`.

# Initialise node1 

Code
./geth --datadir node1 init sskn.json

# Initialise node2
Code
./geth --datadir node2 init sskn.json



# Start node 1
Code
./geth --datadir node1 --mine --miner.threads 1

# Mining node connection url:
2. Copy the enode address in the node 1 terminal



# Open another gitbash window and start node 2, specifying your enode
./geth --datadir node2 --port 30304 --rpc --bootnodes "enode://f9baf4deb50972da983a9b58c581fd9e95c1b23275c7d1236be01e6f1ab9d0da0a4a931fb68912a96ea4fa9e7f180fe0c980ea5ad35e30ef099cc9b96d90e24b@127.0.0.1:30303" --ipcdisable

Open cryto wallet using your public key

# Custom your network same as administer -- vijaysatishnet
Custom your Node Name same as your adminster 
Select Custom field from the dropdown button for Network
Use Network name same as adminster = "vijaysatishnet"
Select ETH as Currency 
Use the same chain ID number as opted earlier = "1207"
use the local network as http://127.0.0.1:8545
save the custom network

# Change Network to your custom network --- "vijaysatishnet"

Enter key store to log back into the account with ETH Balance
enter your netwrok password to access the account

#Select Send Ehter & Tokens option from the top left

#Select the address to send to  and from
Basically use your own address and complete the transaction and send


It will show the pending transaction.
Go back to your Node1   git bash
you can see the new transactions completed and node 1 will show the new block minted

In the gitbash with node 2 running, you can see the new transaction submitted

you can view the status of the trnasction in crypto wallet
It will show the status of the transaction, transaction hash number, block number , amount , gas price for the transaction and other details
